# Sequence-convertor
With this project you can transform a sequence of images to a video, also, you 
can transform a video to a sequence of images. 

---

##To run it

To run it you must have installed Python. 
Open the terminal and run the main.py file, then, the file 
will ask you for two options, so you will choose the one you need.

E.g: 
`C:\sequence-convertor> python main.py` (_Windows_)

---

###Important
In the case of transforming a sequence of images, the video will be outputted
in the directory path that you opened the Terminal 


The same happens when you transform a video to a sequence of images, but the images 
will be saved in a folder called **OUTPUT** (if there's no output folder, 
a new one will be created)

###Graphic example:
**Base Folder before transforming:**
```
sequence-convertor
├─ .main.py
├─ .README.md
├─ .built_in
└─ ...
```
_Transforming a video to a image sequence..._

**Base Folder after transforming:**
```
sequence-convertor
├─ .main.py
├─ .README.md
├─ .built_in
├─ .OUTPUT
│  ├─ frame1.jpg
│  ├─ frame2.jpg
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```
